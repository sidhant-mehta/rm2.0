    - AMBER Care Bundle Baseline Audit

    - '2013-08-28'
    - London
    - ! "The AMBER Care Bundle is a tool that facilitates decision making about patients
      whose condition is deteriorating, are clinically unstable, with an uncertain
      outcome. It helps clinicians have conversations with patients and carers, and
      to work together to make informed, timely decisions in such situations. The
      AMBER care bundle will be introduced throughout UCLH from January 2014 onwards.\r\nThe
      aim of this project is to do a baseline notes audit before implementation to
      look for documented evidence of clinical decision making and communication with
      patients and carers, in patients who fulfil the AMBER bundle criteria.\r\nThe
      clinical notes of 40 (20 per area) consecutive patients who died, either during
      an admission to, or within 100 days of discharge from the Acute Medical Unit
      or Care of the Elderly department, will be reviewed and a proforma completed
      with evidence. Data will be summarised, written up and presented, with potential
      for publication."

      safer hospital and that it is increasingly reflective of and integrated with
      the local communities it serves. He is also proud that the focus on closing
      the local health inequality gap and involvement in King’s Health Partners, is
      attracting more talent to the area, and has also resulted in the growth of employment
      and career opportunities for the local population."
